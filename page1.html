  <div class="subtitle">Here are some of the internet's threats...</div>
<ol>
    <li><div class="underlined">First problem is cyberbullying. </div><br>
        According to a 2018 study on kids' online behavior, 60% of kids who use social media had seen bullying in some capacity, while the majority of kids just chose to ignore the behavior for a variety of reasons. Today's virtual playground is made up mostly of social media and online games, where a lot of cyberbullying occurs around the clock. In social media conversations, children might be made fun of. Alternatively, in online gaming, their virtual characters may be continuously targeted, transforming the game from a creative journey into a degrading experience that intensifies into cyberbullying on several platforms and in real life.
        Being at ease discussing with your kids about what's going on in their lives both online and offline and how to deal with bullies is the greatest way to guard against cyberbullying. 
        
    </li>
    <li><div class="underlined">Second danger is phising. </div><br>
        Phishing is a prevalent kind of cyberattack that targets people via phone calls, texts, emails, and other correspondence. The goal of a phishing attack is to deceive the target into doing the attacker's intended action, which could involve disclosing sensitive information like login credentials for a system or financial information. Phishing techniques are a common cyberattack since they require little money and effort, especially when using email. Phishing scam victims could experience data loss, identity theft, and malware infections, including ransomwar
        Phishing attacks are another tool used by cybercriminals to get direct access to accounts on social media, email, and other platforms, or to get authorization to change and compromise linked systems.
        </li>
    <li><div class="underlined">Third risk is that there is no "delete button". </div><br>
        The most crucial lesson to impart to kids regarding this is that whatever they publish online will always be there. It has always been there. There is a way for someone to view it even if they later remove it. This might one day make it difficult for them to get employment, be used as blackmail, or cause them to feel harassed or ashamed.
      
    </li>
    <li><div class="underlined">Fourth threat is the insecurities created.</div> <br>
        Kids can connect with one another, find new interests, relax, and have fun using apps like TikTok, Snapchat, and Instagram. Yet, being excessively presented to unreasonable pictures of 'magnificence' can once in a while cause kids and youngsters to really regret themselves and their own lives. Numerous suggestions for encouraging your child to feel good about themselves can be found on our page on fostering a healthy body image, which will help lessen the impact of this exposure. Most web-based entertainment destinations have a base age necessity of something like 13+. It's a good idea to talk to your child about who they follow or connect with on social media if they are old enough to do so. You should also remind them that the images they see are often fake or edited.
