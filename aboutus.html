 <div id="aboutus">We are passionate learners who took part in a
     seminar to learn how to code, <br>and during that journey, we realized how important it is to stay safe online. <br> With so much of our daily lives spent on the internet—whether for school, socializing, or just having fun—we saw firsthand how easily people can encounter risks without even knowing it. <br>That's why we decided to create this website about online safety. Our goal is to share helpful tips and information to make sure everyone , no matter their age or experience , knows how to protect themselves in the digital world . We believe that understanding the dangers and learning how to avoid them is key to staying safe online. We hope this website helps you do just that! </div> <br>
