    <h1> About Our Team</h1>
    <h4> A few words about us:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>We are passionate learners who took part in a seminar to learn how to code,
        and during that journey, we realized how important it is to stay safe online.</li>
    <li> With so much of our daily lives spent on the internet—whether for school, socializing, or just having fun—we saw firsthand how easily people can encounter risks without even knowing it. That's why we decided to create this website about online safety.</li>
    <li> Our goal is to share helpful tips and information to make sure everyone , no matter their age or experience , knows how to protect themselves in the digital world .</li>
    <li>We believe that understanding the dangers and learning how to avoid them is key to staying safe online. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> We hope this website helps you do just that!</p>
