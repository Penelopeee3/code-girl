 <div id="aboutus">We are passionate learners who took part in a
     seminar to learn how to code, and during that journey, we realized how important it is to stay safe online. With so much of our daily lives spent on the internet—whether for school, socializing, or just having fun—we saw firsthand how easily people can encounter risks without even knowing it. That's why we decided to create this website about online safety. </div> <br>
